						<p class="jakeBio">Jake has always been fascinated with the boating industry and being on the water. At the age of 15 he bought his first boat and its been an amazing ride ever since. Jake bought the marina 5 years ago and has worked to turn it around into a place where people all over the country come to buy and sell boats and to also experience the greatness that is Brookville Lake.  Jake currently lives in Brookville and is very passionate about the boating community around town. You can contact Jake at Jake @ COMPANYNAME.com</p>

						<p class="jeffBio">Jeff is the General Manager at Jakes Marina. He came to us with knowledge in food sales as well as in depth knowledge in the boating industry from a existing family business that he ran while he was a kid. Before starting at Jakes Marina Jeff owned a large chain of doughnut stores and sold those off to get into the boating industry. Jeff leads all sales and operations for our marina and we are lucky to have him. If you canâ€™t find Jeff selling boats or doughnuts in our marina there is a good chance he is out on the water somewhere.</p>
