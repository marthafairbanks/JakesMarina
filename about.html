						Jake has always been fascinated with the boating industry and being on the water. At the age of 15 he bought his first boat and its been an amazing ride ever since. Jake bought the marina 5 years ago and has worked to turn it around into a place where people all over the country come to buy and sell boats and to also experience the greatness that is Brookville Lake.  Jake currently lives in Brookville and is very passionate about the boating community around town. You can contact Jake at jake@jakesmarina.com</p>

						Jeff is the General Manager at Jake's Marina. He came to us with knowledge in food sales as well as in depth knowledge in the boating industry from a existing family business that he ran while he was a kid. Before starting at Jake's Marina, Jeff owned a large chain of doughnut stores and sold those off to get into the boating industry. Jeff leads all sales and operations for our marina and we are lucky to have him. If you can’t find Jeff selling boats or doughnuts in our marina there is a good chance he is out on the water somewhere.</p>

						<h2>History</h2>
						<p class = "history"><img src = 'http://www.newporthotel.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Marina-View.jpg'>In the late 1940′s, a dock for the area’s burgeoning charter fleet was constructed just north of the inlet. The dock was known first as Roy’s Dock; then as Bill’s Marina, after long time owner Bill Bachstedt. Even to this day, there are still many old timers who frequent our establishment and refer to the Marina as “Bill’s” as they share fish stories from the past. Old photographs of the marina in those days can be seen on the wall next to our main entrance.</p>

						<p>In 1977, the marina was purchased by Brookville inventor and entrepreneur Alex Dreyfoos. Immediately south of Bill’s Marina was another large dock, originally called Bahia Mar, and later, the Sailfish Center (located where our dining room now stands). Dreyfoos acquired this business as well in 1977 and combined the two to form The Sailfish Marina & Resort.</p>

						<p>For a quarter century, the business was under Dreyfoos ownership. During this time the Sailfish Marina & Resort became synonymous with fun and adventure in southern Indiana and gained a national reputation for providing accessibility to Brookville Lake to all.</p>

						<p>In July 2004, the property was sold to Jake Boyles, who has been thoroughly dedicated to keeping what is now called Jake’s Marina a beautiful destination and a staple of the Brookville community.</p>
